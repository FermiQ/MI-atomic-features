    "These notebooks will demonstrate the use of neural networks and genetic algorithms to discover scientific equations, in this case a discretized version of the classical equations of motion. We call the discovered neural networks as parsimonious neural networks (PNNs) as they are designed not only to reproduce the training and testing datasets, but also learn for the simplest, most interpretable equation possible directly from the data.\n",
